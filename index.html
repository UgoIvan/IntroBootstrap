                    <p>This is a front-end web frame work for easy and faster web development. This includes HTML and CSS based designed templates for designing: </p>

                    <p>How to use bootstrap?</p>
                    <p>Start by downloading bootstrap from the internet from the web page list here: <u>https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/download/</u>

You could also download jQuery library which in most cases is used in conjunction with bootstrap it’s purpose will be discussed later. The jQuery link is list here: <u>https://jquery.com/download/.</u>

Extra the content found in the downloaded zip folder and place the CSS based files in a folder called CSS and the JS based files in a folder called JS. This approach is favored over using CDN “Content Deliver Network” approach because the CDN approach requires internet to contact the server that contain the respective JS and CSS files. And incase these severs are down for any reason, your site will not have the design you have chosen. Hence have copies of the JS and CSS files in your working directory is better option “as a man must be responsible for his tools”.
